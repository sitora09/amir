   <h2>Amir Timur Square, Tashkent</h2>
   <p>The history of the square in the center of Tashkent named after Amir Timur, the commander and founder of a huge medieval empire, began as early as in the XIX century, when Tashkent was the center of the Turkestan Military Command, composing the Russian Empire. It was established by order of general M. Chernyaev in 1882. The square represented a small park in the center of the city, surrounded by buildings of women and men’s gymnasium, normal school and state bank.</p>
